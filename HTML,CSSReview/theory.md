# Comments in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## **1. Comments in HTML**
Comments in HTML are used to add notes or explanations within the code, which are ignored by the browser.

**Syntax:**
```html
<!-- This is an HTML comment -->
```

**Example:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Comments in HTML</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- This is a heading -->
    <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## **2. Comments in CSS**
CSS comments are used to describe the styles and are ignored by the browser.

**Syntax:**
```css
/* This is a CSS comment */
```

**Example:**
```css
/* Styling for the main heading */
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

## **3. Comments in JavaScript**
JavaScript supports both single-line and multi-line comments.

**Syntax:**
- **Single-line comment:** `// This is a single-line comment`
- **Multi-line comment:**
  ```js
  /*
    This is a
    multi-line comment
  */
  ```

**Example:**
```js
// Single-line comment
console.log("Hello, World!");

/* Multi-line comment */
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b; // Returns sum of a and b
}
```

# **console.log() Function**
The `console.log()` function is used in JavaScript to print output to the browser's console. It is mainly used for debugging.

**Syntax:**
```js
console.log(value);
```

**Example:**
```js
console.log("Hello, World!"); // Prints "Hello, World!" to the console
console.log(2 + 3); // Prints 5
```

**Usage:**
- Debugging JavaScript code
- Checking variable values
- Displaying messages for developers in the console

This function helps developers track issues in their scripts efficiently.
