# JavaScript Objects 
In JavaScript, an **object**  is a standalone entity composed of properties, which are key-value pairs. Objects allow developers to group related data and functionalities, making the code more organized and manageable.
## Creating an Object 

Objects can be created using different methods:

### 1. Object Literal Syntax 

This is the most common and straightforward way to create an object.


```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 30,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};
```
In this example, `person` is an object with properties: `firstName`, `lastName`, `age`, and `eyeColor`. Each property has a corresponding value.2. Using the `new Object()` SyntaxAnother way to create an object is by using the `Object` constructor.

```javascript
const person = new Object();
person.firstName = "John";
person.lastName = "Doe";
person.age = 30;
person.eyeColor = "blue";
```

This method is less concise than the object literal syntax and is generally less preferred.

## Accessing Object Properties 

Properties of an object can be accessed in two primary ways:

### 1. Dot Notation 


```javascript
console.log(person.firstName); // Output: John
```

### 2. Bracket Notation 


```javascript
console.log(person["lastName"]); // Output: Doe
```

Bracket notation is particularly useful when property names are dynamic or not valid identifiers.
**Example:** 

```javascript
const property = "age";
console.log(person[property]); // Output: 30
```

## Modifying Object Properties 

You can change the value of an existing property or add a new property using both dot and bracket notation.

### Changing Property Values 


```javascript
person.age = 31;
console.log(person.age); // Output: 31
```

### Adding New Properties 


```javascript
person.gender = "male";
console.log(person.gender); // Output: male
```

Alternatively, using bracket notation:


```javascript
person["nationality"] = "American";
console.log(person["nationality"]); // Output: American
```

## Removing Properties from an Object 
To remove a property from an object, use the `delete` operator.

```javascript
delete person.eyeColor;
console.log(person.eyeColor); // Output: undefined
```

## Nested Objects 

Objects can contain other objects, allowing for the creation of complex data structures.


```javascript
const employee = {
  name: "Jane",
  position: "Developer",
  contact: {
    email: "jane@example.com",
    phone: "123-456-7890"
  }
};
```

### Accessing Nested Object Properties 


```javascript
console.log(employee.contact.email); // Output: jane@example.com
```

Or using bracket notation:


```javascript
console.log(employee["contact"]["phone"]); // Output: 123-456-7890
```

## Methods: Functions Inside Objects 

When a function is a property of an object, it's called a method.


```javascript
const calculator = {
  add: function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  },
  subtract: function(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  }
};

console.log(calculator.add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
console.log(calculator.subtract(5, 3)); // Output: 2
```

In modern JavaScript (ES6 and later), you can define methods more concisely:


```javascript
const calculator = {
  add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  },
  subtract(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  }
};
```

## Built-in Objects: JSON and localStorage 

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) 

JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It's often used to send data between a server and a web application.
**Key Points:**  
- **Syntax:**  JSON syntax is a subset of JavaScript object notation but with some differences:
  - Property names must be double-quoted strings.

  - Only supports double-quoted strings; single quotes are not valid.
 
  - Does not support functions or undefined values; only supports strings, numbers, arrays, objects, `true`, `false`, and `null`.
**Example:** 

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 25,
  "isStudent": false
}
```
**Converting Between JavaScript Objects and JSON:**  
- **Stringify:**  Convert a JavaScript object to a JSON string.

```javascript
const obj = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
const jsonString = JSON.stringify(obj);
console.log(jsonString); // Output: '{"name":"Alice","age":25}'
```
 
- **Parse:**  Convert a JSON string back to a JavaScript object.

```javascript
const jsonString = '{"name":"Alice","age":25}';
const obj = JSON.parse(jsonString);
console.log(obj.name); // Output: Alice
```

### localStorage 
The `localStorage` object allows you to store key-value pairs in a web browser. The data persists even after the browser is closed and reopened.**Storing Data:** 

```javascript
localStorage.setItem("username", "Alice");
```
**Retrieving Data:** 

```javascript
const username = localStorage.getItem("username");
console.log(username); // Output: Alice
```
**Storing Objects:** Since `localStorage` only stores strings, you need to convert objects to JSON strings before storing them.

```javascript
const user = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify(user));
```
**Retrieving Objects:** 

```javascript
const userStr = localStorage.getItem("user");
const userObj = JSON.parse(userStr);
console.log(userObj.name); // Output: Alice
```
**Removing Data:** 

```javascript
localStorage.removeItem("username");
```
**Clearing All Data:** 

```javascript
localStorage.clear();
```
**Note:**  Be cautious when storing sensitive information in `localStorage` as it's accessible through JavaScript and can be exploited if not handled properly.
## Why Use Objects? 

Objects are fundamental in JavaScript for structuring data and functionality. They allow developers to:

- Group related data and functions together.

- Create complex data structures.

- Enhance code readability and maintainability.

- Model real-world entities and their interactions.
For a more in-depth understanding, you can refer to the [MDN Web Docs on Working with Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects) .
